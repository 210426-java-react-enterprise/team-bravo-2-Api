# CollectExchange

Ever have an issue trying to organize your collections, or track what collectibles/collections you own without having to dig through and possibly damage your most valuable items?  Or, maybe you are trying to get the word out on a rare item you would like to get rid of or trade? Then our collection management system, CollectExchange, will fill that gap! 

The application allows users to search for desired or owned films via IMDB-API, add searched items to a collection, and personalize each entry by marking them as: owned, wish to ow, availible trade, or even post a personalized note about the item itself.
